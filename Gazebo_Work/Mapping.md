This was done useing Ubuntu 18.04, ROS noetic
The packages used are:
turtlebot3
turtlebot3_msgs

Tutorial: https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/simulation/#gazebo-simulation

The turtlebot 3 simulation packages has scripts that allow for mapping and simulation of the turtlebot in gazebo.
Using SLAM simultion we can create a pgm map file of the imulation. The SLAM functionality can be used woth an actual burgerbot.
After creating the map I will attempt to make the turtlebot move autonomously to a set position on the map.
