This is the code I used to understand writing a subscriber node to interact with a topic in ROS1.
It subscribes to information recived from the "/turtle1/pose" topic.
The information is the position of the turtle in the turtlesim module. This insformation is in the Pose class.
It is then handled by the pose_callback function and outputted to the console
